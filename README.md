# B Movie Plot Generator

##Project Overview
This javascript program generates a randomized B movie plot in the style of low budget
films from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s.  I made this for a codecademy project for the full stack
engineer course.

##How the program works
It is comprised of several arrays of strings.  Each array gets loaded into a single function
that takes an array as an input and returns a randomized item from the array.  Each item
is stored in a variable, and then the random data is output together to form a movie plot.

Most of the work in this project was filling the arrays in data

##Direction for future versions

1.  I plan to change the output from a console.log statement to an alert() statement so that
    I can post the program on my domain, www.golddiggerinitiative.com.
2.  I would like to continually expand the data in the arrays for more crazy, bad movie possibilities.
3.  An upgraded version of this project would convert the arrays of stings to arrays of objects.  This 
    would allow for better much better control of the output text.  Heroes, villains, and sidekicks could
    have appropriate random descriptions and make for better text output with pronoun key/values, and selected
    movie plot elements could have appropriate, but randomized subplots.
